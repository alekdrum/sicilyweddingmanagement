  <h2>What a Wedding Weekend in Sicily Really Means</h2>
  <p>
    Planning a wedding weekend in Sicily involves much more than selecting a beautiful venue.
    It requires coordinating multiple events, suppliers, logistics, and timelines — often from abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
    A typical wedding weekend includes a welcome event, the wedding day itself, and optional additional moments.
    Each element adds complexity that must be managed locally and professionally.

  <h2>Why Sicily Requires Local Management</h2>
  <p>
    Sicily offers extraordinary locations, but many come with strict regulations, access limitations,
    and logistical challenges that are rarely visible online.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without local coordination, couples often face last-minute changes, budget overruns,
    or compromised guest experiences.
